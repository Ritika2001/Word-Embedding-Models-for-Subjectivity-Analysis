# Word-Embedding-Models-for-Subjectivity-Analysis

## **Introduction**

The files and codes uploaded to this repository are part of the paper ***"An Empirical Evaluation of Word Embedding Models for Subjectivity Analysis Tasks"***, presented at the ICAECT 2021 conference and indexed in IEEE Xplore.

**DOI**: ***<https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAECT49130.2021.9392437>***

## **Guide to Usage**

* The folder "Code" contains the python files for all the models as described in the paper.
* The Evaluation.ipynb file outlines the metrics obtained after running each model.
* If you would like to use the checkpoints we've used for our work, feel free to contact [Ritika Nandi](http://www.linkedin.com/in/ritika-nandi), [Shashank Shekhar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashank-shekhar-55a027169) or drop us a mail at _ritika.nandi77@gmail.com_ and we'd be happy to help.
* You are free to reproduce, modify and pretty much do whatever you like with this work as long as you cite our work alongside it.
